```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      error = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE, 
                      results = "asis",
                      fig.path = "img",
                      fig.align = "center",
                      fig.path="img/")

```

Something wrong with my python [yahoo finance](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.1.4) API so tried `R`.

**Goal** Scrape the *Yahoo Finance* summary page of a list of commission-free exchange-traded funds (ETFs) described in [here](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA1000835.pdf) using the ticker symbol it provided.

![Summary table of a fund](img/summary.PNG)

**Data** The ticker symbols are extracted from the pdf already:

```{r}
library(DT)
new_funds = read.csv("data/new funds.csv")
datatable(head(new_funds),
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(searching = FALSE,
                                  paging = FALSE,
                                  ordering = FALSE,
                                  dom = 't'))
```
